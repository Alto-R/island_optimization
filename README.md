## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Formulation

### Objective Function
Minimize total annualized system cost:

```
min: CAPEX_annualized + OPEX_fixed + LNG_costs + Curtailment_penalties + Load_shedding_penalties
```

**Cost Components:**
- **Investment Costs**: Annualized over 20-year lifetime at 5% discount rate
- **Fixed O&M**: Annual maintenance costs proportional to capacity
- **LNG Costs**: Procurement + transportation (distance-based) + fixed charter costs
- **Operational Penalties**: Renewable curtailment, load shedding, energy spillage

### Key Constraints

**Energy Balance (Multi-Energy):**
- Electricity: Generation + storage discharge = demand + conversion loads + storage charge
- Heat: EB + CHP heat + FC heat + TES discharge = heating demand + TES charge  
- Cold: AC + LNGV cold + CES discharge = cooling demand + CES charge
- Hydrogen: PEM production + H2S discharge = FC consumption + H2S charge
- Natural Gas: LNGV gasification = CHP consumption + excess (penalty)

**Reliability Requirements:**
- Expected Energy Not Served (EENS) ‚â§ 0.1% of total demand for each energy carrier
- Evaluated across all clustered failure scenarios with equal probability weighting

**Storage Operations:**
- Cyclic boundary conditions (end state = initial state)
- Self-discharge losses: ESS/H2S (0.01%/hour), TES/CES (5%/hour)
- Power limits: Charge/discharge ‚â§ 25% of storage capacity

**LNG Procurement:**
- Periodic purchasing every 14 days (112 time steps @ 3-hour resolution)
- Disaster-sensitive: No procurement during extreme weather periods
- Storage balance with consumption for CHP and gasification

### Reliability Analysis Methodology

**1. Monte Carlo Simulation:**
- Generate 1000 independent equipment failure scenarios
- Weather-dependent failure probabilities for renewable technologies
- Repair time modeling with weather constraints

**2. Scenario Reduction:**
- Extract statistical features: total downtime, max consecutive failures, event frequency
- K-means clustering with automatic cluster selection using silhouette coefficient
- Select representative scenarios closest to cluster centroids

**3. Robust Optimization:**
- Ensure system reliability across all representative failure scenarios
- Minimize worst-case energy shortfalls through shortfall variables
